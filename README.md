The main functionality of this program is to allow a user to enter symptoms and give them an estimate on whether they have tonsilitis or not.
It does this using naive bayes' machine learning algorithm. This algorithm uses pre-existing training data in order to give a specific result based on entered symptoms

The program also allows the user to test the accuracy of the data by using test data. This test data is run through the algorithm which is then scored based on how many accurate predictions it made.


The program also allows the user to select the files which are used for training and testing the algorithm. If a csv file is not selected, the program will revert to the previously chosen file.
Default files have already been set.
